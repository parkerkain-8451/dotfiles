# Parker Kain - dotfiles 🗂️

This repo contains various configurations I use across tools. For setting up an 
individual tool - please see that directory's `README.md` file.

In general - things will work best if you clone this repo on Mac and keep the repo at
`~/dotfiles`

## Prerequisites

You need to install a Nerd Font to get terminal icons! Check out the brew library for nerd fonts and choose one of your liking.
